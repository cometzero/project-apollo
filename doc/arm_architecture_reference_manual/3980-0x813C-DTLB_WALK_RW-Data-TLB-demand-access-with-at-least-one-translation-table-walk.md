##### `0x813C`, DTLB\_WALK\_RW, Data TLB demand access, with at least one translation table walk

The counter counts each demand access counted by [L1D\_TLB\_RW](/documentation/ddi0487/mc/-Part-D-The-AArch64-System-Level-Architecture/-Chapter-D14-PMU-Event-Descriptions/-D14-3-Common-event-numbers/-0x8130--L1D-TLB-RW--Level-1-data-TLB-access--demand-access?lang=en#event_l1d_tlb_rw) that causes a refill or update of a data or unified TLB involving at least one translation table walk access.

The counter does not count the demand access if any of the following are true:

- The access is due to a TLB maintenance instruction.
- The access generates a Translation fault because the applicable [TCR\_ELx](/documentation/ddi0487/mc/-Part-K-Appendixes/-Appendix-K14-Registers-Index/-K14-1-Introduction-and-register-disambiguation/-K14-1-2-Register-name-disambiguation-by-Exception-level?lang=en#tcr_elx).EPDy bit is 1.
- FEAT\_E0PD is implemented and the access is an unprivileged access that generates a Translation fault because the applicable [TCR\_ELx](/documentation/ddi0487/mc/-Part-K-Appendixes/-Appendix-K14-Registers-Index/-K14-1-Introduction-and-register-disambiguation/-K14-1-2-Register-name-disambiguation-by-Exception-level?lang=en#tcr_elx).E0PDy bit is 1.
- FEAT\_SVE is implemented and the access is a non-fault access that fails because the applicable [TCR\_ELx](/documentation/ddi0487/mc/-Part-K-Appendixes/-Appendix-K14-Registers-Index/-K14-1-Introduction-and-register-disambiguation/-K14-1-2-Register-name-disambiguation-by-Exception-level?lang=en#tcr_elx).NFDy bit is 1.

It is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether the counter counts the demand access if the access generates a Translation fault for any other reason.

If the TLB is shared and the Effective value of [PMEVTYPER<n>\_EL0](/documentation/ddi0487/mc/-Part-D-The-AArch64-System-Level-Architecture/-Chapter-D24-AArch64-System-Register-Descriptions/-D24-5-Performance-Monitors-registers/-D24-5-12-PMEVTYPER-n--EL0--Performance-Monitors-Event-Type-Registers--n---0---30?lang=en#reg_aarch64_pmevtypern_el0).MT for the counter is 0, then the counter counts only events Attributable to the PE counting the event. For a multithreaded processor implementation, if the TLB is shared by PEs other than the PEs in the multithreaded processor and the Effective value of [PMEVTYPER<n>\_EL0](/documentation/ddi0487/mc/-Part-D-The-AArch64-System-Level-Architecture/-Chapter-D24-AArch64-System-Register-Descriptions/-D24-5-Performance-Monitors-registers/-D24-5-12-PMEVTYPER-n--EL0--Performance-Monitors-Event-Type-Registers--n---0---30?lang=en#reg_aarch64_pmevtypern_el0).MT for the counter is 1, then the counter counts only events Attributable to PEs in the multithreaded processor. In all other cases, it is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether only events Attributable to the PE counting the event or all events are counted, and might depend on the Effective value of [PMEVTYPER<n>\_EL0](/documentation/ddi0487/mc/-Part-D-The-AArch64-System-Level-Architecture/-Chapter-D24-AArch64-System-Register-Descriptions/-D24-5-Performance-Monitors-registers/-D24-5-12-PMEVTYPER-n--EL0--Performance-Monitors-Event-Type-Registers--n---0---30?lang=en#reg_aarch64_pmevtypern_el0).MT.
