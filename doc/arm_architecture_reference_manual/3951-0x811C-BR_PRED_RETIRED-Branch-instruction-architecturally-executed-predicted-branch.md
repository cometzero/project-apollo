##### `0x811C`, BR\_PRED\_RETIRED, Branch instruction architecturally executed, predicted branch

The counter counts each instruction counted by [BR\_RETIRED](/documentation/ddi0487/mc/-Part-D-The-AArch64-System-Level-Architecture/-Chapter-D14-PMU-Event-Descriptions/-D14-3-Common-event-numbers/-0x0021--BR-RETIRED--Instruction-architecturally-executed--branch?lang=en#event_br_retired) that is not counted by [BR\_MIS\_PRED\_RETIRED](/documentation/ddi0487/mc/-Part-D-The-AArch64-System-Level-Architecture/-Chapter-D14-PMU-Event-Descriptions/-D14-3-Common-event-numbers/-0x0022--BR-MIS-PRED-RETIRED--Branch-instruction-architecturally-executed--mispredicted?lang=en#event_br_mis_pred_retired).

These are all branch instructions on the architecturally executed path, where the branch is correctly predicted.
