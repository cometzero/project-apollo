##### `0x8134`, DTLB\_HWUPD, Data TLB hardware update of translation table

The counter counts each access counted by [L1D\_TLB](/documentation/ddi0487/mc/-Part-D-The-AArch64-System-Level-Architecture/-Chapter-D14-PMU-Event-Descriptions/-D14-3-Common-event-numbers/-0x0025--L1D-TLB--Level-1-data-TLB-access?lang=en#event_l1d_tlb) that causes a hardware update of a translation table entry.

Each attempted hardware update of a translation table entry is counted once. If the PE requires multiple translation table walk accesses to perform an update, this counts as a single update. If the update fails because it would not be atomic and has to be retried, each retry is counted.

The counter does not count the access if any of the following are true:

- The access generates a Translation fault because the applicable [TCR\_ELx](/documentation/ddi0487/mc/-Part-K-Appendixes/-Appendix-K14-Registers-Index/-K14-1-Introduction-and-register-disambiguation/-K14-1-2-Register-name-disambiguation-by-Exception-level?lang=en#tcr_elx).EPDy bit is 1.
- The access is an unprivileged access that generates a Translation fault because the applicable [TCR\_ELx](/documentation/ddi0487/mc/-Part-K-Appendixes/-Appendix-K14-Registers-Index/-K14-1-Introduction-and-register-disambiguation/-K14-1-2-Register-name-disambiguation-by-Exception-level?lang=en#tcr_elx).E0PDy bit is 1.
- FEAT\_SVE is implemented and the access is a non-fault access that fails because the applicable [TCR\_ELx](/documentation/ddi0487/mc/-Part-K-Appendixes/-Appendix-K14-Registers-Index/-K14-1-Introduction-and-register-disambiguation/-K14-1-2-Register-name-disambiguation-by-Exception-level?lang=en#tcr_elx).NFDy bit is 1.

It is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether the counter counts the access if the access generates a Translation fault for any other reason.

If the TLB is shared and the Effective value of [PMEVTYPER<n>\_EL0](/documentation/ddi0487/mc/-Part-D-The-AArch64-System-Level-Architecture/-Chapter-D24-AArch64-System-Register-Descriptions/-D24-5-Performance-Monitors-registers/-D24-5-12-PMEVTYPER-n--EL0--Performance-Monitors-Event-Type-Registers--n---0---30?lang=en#reg_aarch64_pmevtypern_el0).MT for the counter is 0, then the counter counts only events Attributable to the PE counting the event. For a multithreaded processor implementation, if the TLB is shared by PEs other than the PEs in the multithreaded processor and the Effective value of [PMEVTYPER<n>\_EL0](/documentation/ddi0487/mc/-Part-D-The-AArch64-System-Level-Architecture/-Chapter-D24-AArch64-System-Register-Descriptions/-D24-5-Performance-Monitors-registers/-D24-5-12-PMEVTYPER-n--EL0--Performance-Monitors-Event-Type-Registers--n---0---30?lang=en#reg_aarch64_pmevtypern_el0).MT for the counter is 1, then the counter counts only events Attributable to PEs in the multithreaded processor. In all other cases, it is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether only events Attributable to the PE counting the event or all events are counted, and might depend on the Effective value of [PMEVTYPER<n>\_EL0](/documentation/ddi0487/mc/-Part-D-The-AArch64-System-Level-Architecture/-Chapter-D24-AArch64-System-Register-Descriptions/-D24-5-Performance-Monitors-registers/-D24-5-12-PMEVTYPER-n--EL0--Performance-Monitors-Event-Type-Registers--n---0---30?lang=en#reg_aarch64_pmevtypern_el0).MT.
